                  Grant Wood, famous for his representations of the Midwest—of
                  which the Art Institute’s American Gothic (1930.934) is his
                  most recognizable example—intended The Pump to be an

                  This image of a contemporary water pump would have been a
                  perfect fit for Lewis’s novel about life in a midwestern town.
                  The drawing was given to the Art Institute by Carter Manny,
                  Jr., who received it as a high school graduation gift from the
                  artist in 1937.

                  This evocative character study is an early example of a type
                  of subject that preoccupied the great Dutch master Rembrandt
                  van Rijn throughout his long career. Although his large output
                  included landscapes, genre paintings, and the occasional still

                  In 1886 Vincent van Gogh left his native Holland and settled
                  in Paris, where his beloved brother Theo was a dealer in
                  paintings. Van Gogh created at least twenty-four
                  self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic
                  French capital.

                  “He loves everything that is joyous, brilliant, and consoling

                  Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This may explain why Two Sisters (On

                    For many years these works, along with other beloved
                    paintings and sculptures, have been located in galleries
                    262–65 in the Rice Building. We in Arts of the Americas
                    recently re-envisioned and reinstalled these galleries,
                    seeking to present art of North America in a more lively and
                    engaging manner. Our intention was to contextualize old
                    favorites in new ways, introduce a greater variety of
                    objects, and offer more complex and interesting narratives
                    that highlight the true breadth and depth of our collection.

                    With this reinstallation, it was important to bring works by
                    Native American artists into these galleries to create a
                    more inclusive, expansive, and simply more accurate
                    presentation of American art. These additions do not replace
                    our dedicated gallery of Native and Indigenous art in the
                    Morton Wing, but rather are a complement to it.
